# PEB-Crawl-POC
A basic proof of concept of a walk with ntdll to load kernel32.h &amp; create a process without using windows.h or winternl.h, in C++.

## Dev Notes

I am still working on the final type definitions for windows.h to fully remove the native/dynamic windows header from winternl.h. Main functionality is converted, but must add more to be 100% off of windows.h. Updates soon <3 :)
